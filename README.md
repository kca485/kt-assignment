## Tech Documentation

Currently the website is relatively small and simple,
so there isn't any real needs to use additional tools.

I use `react-router` to show that I don't mind using libraries from the Javascript/React ecosystem.
It is mature, easy to use, and a lot of other developers already have some experience with it.

I thought to install other libraries too, such as for state management, or maybe manage the style with CSS modules or tailwind, but it seems unnecessary.
